# SSIM Model
***

This is the SSIM model for "SSIMâ€”A Deep Learning Approach for Recovering Missing Time Series Sensor Data" Link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8681112

Considering the dataset we are using in the paper is not public available, we use a different open dataset for demo. 

The original PM2.5 data can be download from:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data

The Pytorch implementation has not been fully tested.
Bugs may be fixed later.
